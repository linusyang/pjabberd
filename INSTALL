Installation
------------

At the moment, the server does not support installation, because it is not meant to be run standalone yet. Once we have a concrete implementation in place, an installation procedure will be provided.

Running
-------

Running the existing incomplete implementation is possible:

    $ cd pjabberd
    $ python pjabberd.py

`pysqlite` is required to run the current version.
