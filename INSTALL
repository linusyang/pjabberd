Installation
------------

At the moment, the server does not support installation, because it is not meant to be run standalone yet. Once we have a concrete implementation in place, an installation procedure will be provided.

Running
-------

Running the existing incomplete implementation is possible as long as the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable contains the top-level jabber directory that itself contains the `pjs` directory.

    $ cd code/jabber
    $ PYTHONPATH=. python pjs/pjsserver.py

`pysqlite` is required to run the current version.
